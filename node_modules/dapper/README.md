# Dapper

A OOCSS utility toolkit library and framework using [component](https://github.com/component/component), [rework](https://github.com/visionmedia/rework) and [autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer) motiviated by front-end frameworks like bootstrap and foundation,
as well as modular component frameworks such as [suit](https://github.com/suitcss/suit).

The goal is to create a framework you can't outgrow.
Frameworks like bootstrap and foundation are great,
but once you start doing your own styling,
the framework becomes a burden.
You have to work around the rules and opinions they've set for you.
But not with Dapper!

For a walkthrough, view the modal example [walkthrough](http://github.com/dappercss/example-modal) and [demo](http://dappercss.github.io/example-modal).

#### Unopinionated

You inherit rules like so:

```css
.navigation-menu {
  inherit: %horizontal-list;
}
```

You decide selector names, not Dapper.
There's no global selector pollution.
There's no crazy selectors to avoid global pollution.
And placeholders are semantic - `%horizontal-list` means it's a horizontal list!

Styles are also minimal and functional.
You should never have to work around them.

Aside from `inherit:` (or `inherits:`, `extend:`, `extends:`),
you're writing plain CSS.
There's no choosing between `SASS`, `SCSS`, `Less`, or `Stylus`.
That's as unopinionated as you can be with preprocessors.
Using a preprocessor may still work with Dapper,
but only if it keeps all placeholders intact after compiling.

#### Modular

Dapper is split into multiple repositories,
allowing you to work with only parts of Dapper.
This gives you leverage against Dapper v1, v2, v3 changes,
though the goal is to never reach v2.

#### Tiny final footprint

Thanks to placeholders, rules you don't use won't be included in your final build.
Each rule is only defined once,
so there's no repetition like you see with Less mixins.
Don't worry about large builds with unused CSS like you do in Bootstrap.

## component install dappercss/dapper

Install all of dapper's placeholder classes in your build.
You are expected to run the final build through your own rework reprocessor using [rework.extend()](https://github.com/reworkcss/rework-inherit),
or you can just use `dapper(1)`.

## dapper(1)

```js
npm i -g dapper
```

A minimalist [rework](https://github.com/visionmedia/rework) and [autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer) CSS preprocessor.
When using dapper, you are expected to use your own rework setup that includes both `rework.extend()` and `autoprefixer`.
If you don't want to create your own CSS preprocessor,
you can always just use `dapper(1)`.

### dapper \[\<input\>\] \[\<output\>\]

`input` is optional and is the input CSS file.
`output` is optional and is the output CSS file.
Setting either one as `-` means `stdin` or `stdout`, respectively.

Example build process:

```bash
# install dependencies
component install
# build everything
component build
# overwrite the CSS build
dapper build/build.css build/build.css
# print the output
dapper build/build.css -
```
