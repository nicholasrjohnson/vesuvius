## Inspiration

[dapper][dapper] is inspired by [suit][suit],
written by [necolas][necolas].
However, relies on [rework][rework]'s [`extend()`][rework-inherit] plugin.
[suit][suit], on the other hand, is closer to pure CSS specifications.
Thus, it is slightly more opinionated,
but it has many more benefits:

- No weird class names to avoid global conflicts.
  There are no class names like `.u-linkClean` which damages eyes.
- Unused rules are not added to the final build.
  If you don't use a placeholder rule,
  it'll be like it never existed.
- Cleaner final CSS output as it encourages [OOCSS](http://ianstormtaylor.com/oocss-plus-sass-is-the-best-way-to-css/).

## Philosophy

### Unopinionated

Make rules as unopinionated as possible.
Each rule should be functional,
and its placeholder name should describe its function.
When it doubt, leave it out.

### Readable English

Placeholder names should be how you would describe them when talking.
For example, you would say `%horizontal-list`,
but not `%list-horizontal` or `%li-horizontal`.
On the other hand, you would call it `%horizontal-dl` because no body says "description list" in real life.

## Technical

### Why do the examples inherit: instead of extend:?

Examples will generally look like this:

```css
button {
  inherit: %button-reset;
}
```

This is because [`rework.extend()`](rework-inherit) works with `extend:`, `extends:`, `inherit:`, and `inherits:`.
`inherit:` is used merely because it becomes syntax highlighted.
