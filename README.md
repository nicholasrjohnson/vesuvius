Vesuvius Project
---------------------------------
I had this idea to have a 2d game with a volcano in the center of the screen shooting out fireballs. There are a couple 3d games out there that may have eye candy, but nothing as arcady as this
idea. I think I was thinking of something on the Internet where people could come and try and get a high score with some sadistic fun. Little men will be running away from the volcano,
and you pick them up with your mouse cursor and throw then in the fire. I initially envisioned this with Box2d. I want to use Phaser 3 for this, https://phaser.io/phaser3, and it does have a Box2d
extension, but that is for Phaser 2, so that is a bummer. Box2d is what Angry Birds uses for their physics. I think this still can be done without Box2d, and maybe I can put together 
some simple physics even if I don't that. It may have been overkill anyway.
